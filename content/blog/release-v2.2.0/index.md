Version 2.2.0 of SWSheets was released on 02/02/2020.

This was a bug fix release. Not that bug fixes are exciting, but here are a few worth mentioning.

- Fix broken cycle arrows on Lightsaber skill buttons.
- Present a nice error to the user when they attempt to save a character field with a value that is too long.
- Don't allow the password reset form to be submitted blank.

The last one deserves a special note as it was done by Sean from SWSheets! That's the power of open source software. A user decided to help out, submitted some code, and it is already making the site better.

Thanks [Sean](https://swsheets.com/u/sean)!
